## Project Summary

Prometheus Protocol is the open-source trust layer for the decentralized AI economy on the Internet Computer. We provide a seamless, on-chain experience for **identity, verifiable trust, and programmable payments**‚Äîempowering users, agents, and developers to participate in an open, secure machine-to-machine economy. Our full-stack solution includes a verifiable App Store, an on-chain OAuth 2.1 identity provider, and a complete developer toolchain with a CLI and SDKs.

## Problem

As autonomous AI agents proliferate, they rely on a decentralized network of specialized servers (MCPs) to perform their work. But this creates a fundamental problem: **how can an agent, or its owner, trust a third-party server?** How can we be sure it's secure, reliable, and won't manipulate data or poison AI models? This lack of a unified trust layer fragments the AI economy and hinders its growth.

---

## Solution Overview

**Prometheus Protocol** provides the solution by creating a transparent, on-chain "app store" for AI infrastructure, governed by cryptographic proofs, economic incentives, and a decentralized community.

## Hackathon Submission Highlights

For the WCHL25 National Round, our team focused on building the complete **Trust Layer** to complement our existing economic foundation. This represents a massive leap forward, delivering a full-stack, end-to-end solution for a secure software supply chain.

**Key features built and delivered during this round include:**

- **The Verifiable App Store Backend:** A fully on-chain registry for MCP servers, architected on open ICRC standards (118, 120, 126, 127). It manages versions, cryptographic proofs, and audit attestations, all governed by a DAO.
- **The Prometheus CLI (`prom-cli`):** A purpose-built command-line interface that serves both sides of the ecosystem:
  - **For Developers:** `prom-cli submit` allows developers to publish their MCP servers and submit new versions for verification.
  - **For Auditors:** `prom-cli status` and `attest` commands enable auditors to discover open bounties, review code, and file on-chain cryptographic attestations.
- **The App Store Frontend:** A user-facing web application for the discovery and inspection of MCP servers. Users can browse the registry and dive deep into any server's on-chain **Prometheus Certificate** to see the underlying audit proofs.
- **Full Integration of ICRC Standards:** We composed five different ICRC standards into a single, cohesive system, demonstrating the power of the IC's open protocols.

## Monetization & Sustainability

Our protocol is designed as a self-sustaining economic flywheel for the entire AI ecosystem on ICP.

1.  **Enabling Monetization (The Foundation):** Our OAuth 2.1 server provides the essential tools for any developer to monetize their AI services with on-chain micropayments.
2.  **Driving Discovery & Trust (The Marketplace):** The App Store is the public marketplace where users and agents discover these monetized servers. The Prometheus Certificate acts as a powerful signal of quality and security, reducing friction and encouraging user adoption. **Trust is the lubricant for economic activity.**
3.  **Protocol Sustainability (The DAO Treasury):** The long-term sustainability of the protocol will be managed by the Prometheus DAO. In the future, the DAO can vote to introduce a micro-fee on transactions processed by the economic layer. These funds would flow directly to the DAO treasury to fund ongoing development, security audits, and ecosystem grants, ensuring Prometheus remains a well-maintained public good.

## Challenges & Learnings

Building a full-stack, on-chain trust layer presented several unique challenges during the hackathon:

1.  **On-Chain OAuth 2.1 Security:** Implementing a secure OAuth server on a public blockchain required a novel approach. We leveraged mandatory PKCE, certified responses, and a unique `request_id` system to protect against code interception and malicious boundary nodes, ensuring that secret access tokens are never publicly exposed.
2.  **ICRC Standard Composability:** Integrating five different ICRC standards (1, 2, 118, 120, 126, 127) into a cohesive system was a significant architectural challenge. It required careful state management and inter-canister communication patterns to ensure data consistency and atomicity where needed.
3.  **CLI Tooling & Build Process:** Creating a professional CLI with a unified developer experience required solving complex build issues, particularly managing ESM/CJS module compatibility between our shared libraries and the final executable, which we solved using `esbuild`'s `define` and `external` features.
