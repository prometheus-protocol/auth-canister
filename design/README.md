Our mission is to enable a new generation of decentralized applications by providing the open-source, on-chain foundation for verifiable trust, secure identity, and near-zero fee payments.

## How Might We (HMW)

How might we empower developers, users, and organizations to confidently build, discover, and transact with decentralized applications—by providing a seamless, transparent, and secure on-chain experience that sets a new standard for trust, identity, and payments?

## The Issue

As autonomous AI agents become more powerful and influential, the infrastructure they depend on grows critically important. These agents—whether serving users, organizations, or other systems—must connect to specialized servers to access resources, data, and computational power.

But this new landscape raises urgent questions:

- How can an agent, or its owner, trust that a third-party server is secure, reliable, and won’t manipulate data or poison its model?
- How can developers of these servers prove to their users that they are trustworthy, compliant, and operating with integrity?

This is the core challenge at the frontier of decentralized AI:Building a foundation of verifiable trust, security, and transparency for every connection, transaction, and interaction.

## The Solution

Prometheus Protocol is a fully transparent, trustless “app store” for AI infrastructure—purpose-built to solve the modern challenges of decentralized trust.
Unlike traditional systems that rely on a central authority for approval and oversight, Prometheus leverages a transparent, on-chain process governed by cryptographic proofs and open economic incentives. Every step, from server registration to audit and endorsement, is publicly verifiable and tamper-proof.

Before any new version of an MCP server can be published, it must pass a series of community-driven audits. This ensures that only secure, reliable, and transparent infrastructure is available in the ecosystem—giving both agents and their owners true peace of mind, and providing server developers with a clear, objective path to earning user trust.

Prometheus Protocol sets a new standard for trust, accountability, and transparency in the emerging AI agent economy.

## The Three Pillars of Trustworthy Digital Economy

To build a foundation of lasting trust in decentralized applications, security and transparency must be engineered at every layer. Prometheus Protocol is designed around three core pillars—Secure Identity & Authorization, Verifiable Trust & Discovery, and Direct & Efficient Payments—each solving a fundamental challenge for the next generation of users, developers, and organizations.

Together, these pillars form an integrated solution for secure access, reliable app discovery, and seamless, user-controlled payments—enabling a digital economy where trust is verifiable, not just promised.
